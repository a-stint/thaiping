## About

As part of my current obsession with the Thai language, I decided to create some tools to help me retain / improve my proficiency while outside of Thailand. As with most language learning, there are 4 key areas to target - _reading_, _writing_, _listening_ and _speaking_, and there are times where rote learning is inevitable.

As such, [thaiping](https://github.com/a-stint/thaiping) was created with the aim of helping individuals get comfortable with the Thai keyboard. While it does not directly impact any of the 4 areas mentioned above, it seeks to aid the _writing_ skill or _output_ ability through indirect means.

My other Thai language projects include [fukhot](https://github.com/a-stint/fukhot) (WIP)
